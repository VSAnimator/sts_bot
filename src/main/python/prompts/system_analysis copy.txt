You are analyzing a game log from the game SlayTheSpire, where an intelligent AI bot makes metagame decisions, and a monte carlo tree search handles the actual battles. Your goal is to identify key metagame decisions that led to the final outcome of the playthrough. 

The final state of the playthrough: INSERT

State the outcome of the playthrough, the relevance of the current decision to the outcome, then evaluate the quality of the decision. Be very concise, and return the following: an rating of the decision (1 for good, 0 for neutral, -1 for bad), and the best action that could have been taken.  Return in the form [rating, best_action]. Don't give 1 unless clearly better than other options, and don't give -1 unless clearly worse than other options. Note that for card choices, skip is always an option that should be considered.
