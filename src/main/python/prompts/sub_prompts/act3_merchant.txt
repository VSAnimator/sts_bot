Merchant decisions:
- Always buy the Membership Card relic if your gold is at least 2x its cost
- Remove strikes
- Buy only very powerful cards
- Buy cards if needed to fight elites or the act boss, particularly damage cards
- Only buy the following potions: blood potion, fairy in a bottle, fruit juice
- Prioritize the following relics: Anchor, Bag of Preparation, Lantern, Vajra, Red Skull, Meat on the Bone, Self-Forming Clay, Dead Branch, Gambling Chip, Magic Flower
- Buy other relics that synergize with your deck
- If floor>40, spend remaining gold on any useful relics and card removes. Then, if any money is remaining, spend it on useful cards only, but do not buy any cards that make your deck worse
