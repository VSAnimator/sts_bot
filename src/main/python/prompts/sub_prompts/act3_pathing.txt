Pathing decisions:
- Aim to fight as many elites as possible if you have a strong deck
- Prefer fighting elites later, especially after a camp fire
- Do not fight an elite if your HP is low or if your deck doesn't have enough damage
- The first 2 combats are from the "easy pool".  Further combats are from the "hard pool".  Prioritize easy pool fights, but delay hard pool fights until you have more damage.
- If floor>40 and gold>300, heavily prioritize pathing to a shop
