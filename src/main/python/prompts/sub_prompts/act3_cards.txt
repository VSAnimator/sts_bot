Card decisions:
- Take cards that will help you fight the elites and the act boss
- Make sure you get enough damage to win the act boss fight
- If you can easily beat the act boss, focus on cards that will help with the act 4 heart fight
- Take cards to have a mix of damage, block and scaling
- Make sure you take cards later in the act to fight the act boss.  Different bosses pose different challenges.
- Do not take bad cards.  Very strongly consider skipping cards.
- Generally good cards to pick: Reaper, Feed, Pommel Strike,  Impervious, Offering
- Strongly consider Ironclad's general synergies: (1) Strength gain + playing lots of attacks and attack with multiple hits and (2) exhaust synergies with powerful powers
- Consider Ironclad's defense synergies: Cards that synergize with block: Juggernaut and body slam to do damage and entrench to double block.  Cards to gain block: feel no pain and exhaust cards to gain block, impervious, shrug it off
