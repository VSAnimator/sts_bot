Pathing decisions:
- In the first 5 floors, aim to fight as many regular monsters as possible. Avoid elites until floor 8 or later.
- Aim to fight 2 or 3 elites total in the stage.
- Prefer fighting elites after a camp fire or when HP is high.
- Do not fight an elite if your HP is low or if your deck doesn't have enough damage.
- The first 3 combats are from the "easy pool".  Further combats are from the "hard pool".  Prioritize easy pool fights, but delay hard pool fights until you have more damage.
