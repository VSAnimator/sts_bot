Pathing advice:

Step 1 - Identify the paths with the most elites. Break ties by prioritizing a campfire and 3 hallways before the first elite. Further take note if there is a shop towards the end of the path. 
This is your ideal path if things are going well. 

Step 2 - Consider whether that path seems doable given the current deck/relics. A 3 elite path with no fire until after the 3rd elite is not going to be doable too often. If the path is questionable, are we able to deviate to a different path that is still pretty good?  Are we able to rest at a campfire before we die if things are going poorly? 

Step 3 - If the answer to both the previous questions is no, the path is too risky. Try to evaluate paths using my discussion of each type of node above. If all 3 elite paths seem too risky, consider taking a path that could deviate to become a 3 elite path if things are going very well. Sometimes you will receive an immolate very early and a path that was previously risky is now safe. If all 3 elite paths seem too risky, consider taking on the spicy elite, prioritizing ? nodes that are before an optional shop, or at least visiting a shop toward the end of the act.
