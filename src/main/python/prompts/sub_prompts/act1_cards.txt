Card decisions:
- Early in the act, take damage and strength cards, preparing to fight the act 1 elites and harder combats later in the act
- Prioritize cards that will help with the next few floors
- If you can easily beat the act boss, focus on cards that will help with act 2, particularly AOE damage cards
- Take 1 or 2 block cards
- Make sure you take cards later in the act to fight the act boss.  Different bosses pose different challenges.
- Do not take bad cards.  Strongly consider skipping cards.
- Consider Ironclad's general synergies: (1) Strength gain + playing lots of attacks and attack with multiple hits and (2) exhaust synergies with powerful powers
